 <p>Lasagna is a layered Italian dish made with pasta sheets, meat or vegetable sauce, béchamel, and melted cheese, baked until golden and bubbly. It's a hearty, comforting meal perfect for family gatherings.</p>
 
 <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    
 <ul>
    <li><b>Meat</b>: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li><br>
    <li><b>Onion</b>: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li><br>
    <li><b>Canned tomatoes</b>: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li><br>
    <li><b>Fresh herbs</b>: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li><br>
    <li><b>Sugar</b>: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li><br>
    <li><b>Noodles</b>: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li><br>
    <li><b>Cheese</b>: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li><br>
    <li><b>Eggs</b>: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li><br>
    <li><b>Spices and seasonings</b>: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li><br>
 </ul>

    <li><b>Cook the noodles</b>: Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li><br>
    <li><b>Make the cheese layer</b>: Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li><br>
